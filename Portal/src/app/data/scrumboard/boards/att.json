There is a concern from the business in regards to content that would be found on the Wireless and Wearables landers.  Below is a snapshot from the Wireless comp:  H1, image, title, and description are the elements found.\r\nThe concern is if we omit the descriptions found within the tiles will this impact SEO or is there a way to add it to the meta data for SEO?  Leadership would like to remove it as it seems to have no value to the customer facing experience, and creates noise on the page, as well as usability has shown user's don't read the descriptions, only when the title is not informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D15D18.CBCEC8E0]\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a call is needed.\r\n\r\nBest and thank you kindly,\r\nMichelle\r\n\r\nMichelle Schultz\r\nSenior Producer | Wireless Sales\r\nAT&T Digital Design & UX\r\n* Cell: 206.375.2928 (L) 206.674.6783\r\nms165@att.com<mailto:ms165@att.com>\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D15D18.CBCEC8E0]Q Me!<qto://talk/ms165h>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of this email and any attachments are private and confidential.

There is a concern from the business in regards to content that would be found on the Wireless and Wearables landers.  Below is a snapshot from the Wireless comp:  H1, image, title, and description are the elements found.\r\nThe concern is if we omit the descriptions found within the tiles will this impact SEO or is there a way to add it to the meta data for SEO?  Leadership would like to remove it as it seems to have no value to the customer facing experience, and creates noise on the page, as well as usability has shown user's don't read the descriptions, only when the title is not informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D15CC2.70A86530]\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a call is needed.\r\n\r\nBest and thank you kindly,\r\nMichelle\r\n\r\nMichelle Schultz\r\nSenior Producer | Wireless Sales\r\nAT&T Digital Design & UX\r\n* Cell: 206.375.2928 (L) 206.674.6783\r\nms165@att.com<mailto:ms165@att.com>\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D15CC2.70A86530]Q Me!<qto://talk/ms165h>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of this email and any attachments are private and confidential.

Keyword Performance Insights\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the 7-day period of 1/18 to 1/24 (the most recent keyword-level data available from Google Search Console), we are seeing the following trends for att.com:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese notable keywords increased in WoW clicks to the desktop site from Google organic search:\r\n\r\n•                        Unlimited data plan at&t (+1,096)\r\n\r\n•                        at&t smart limits (+564)\r\n\r\n•                        at&t unlimited plan (+418)\r\n\r\n•                        smart limits (+293)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese notable keywords declined in WoW clicks to the desktop site from Google organic search:\r\n\r\n•                        my at&t (-975)\r\n\r\n•                        iphone 5s (-655)\r\n\r\n•                        att unlock (-599)\r\n\r\n•                        att unlock my iphone (-362)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese notable keywords increased in WoW clicks to the mobile site from Google organic search:\r\n\r\n•                        at&t unlimited data (+1,414)\r\n\r\n•                        at&t unlimited plan (+755)\r\n\r\n•                        unlimited data at&t (+613)\r\n\r\n•                        at&t data plans (+417)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese notable keywords declined in WoW clicks to the mobile site from Google organic search:\r\n\r\n•                        at&t iphone 6s plus (-142)\r\n\r\n•                        iphone 6 plus (-134)\r\n\r\n•                        iphone 5c (-77)\r\n\r\n•                        iphone 6 plus at&t (-72)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic & Sales Takeaways\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic remained flat at 1% WoW\r\n\r\n•         Growth in search interest around unlimited plans was flat WoW with Search Console reporting a 1% decline in clicks from “unlimited” terms.\r\nThe good news is that the majority of unlimited traffic has now shifted to the proper unlimited plan marketing page<https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/unlimited-plan.html>, instead of the data usage page<https://www.att.com/esupport/datausage/datausage.d.jsp> and features list page<https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/features/featureslist.html> which captured a greater share of the search interest in previous weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic grew by 38% MoM\r\n\r\n•         Seasonality and unlimited data plan & Next announcement continue to be the main factors of MoM traffic growth in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic grew by 5% YoY\r\n\r\n•         Unlimited data plan & Next announcement continue to be strong factors of YoY traffic growth in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSales declined by 4% WoW\r\n\r\n•         Search console reported a WoW decline in clicks from both branded & non-branded iphone keywords. The WoW declines may in part be due to the growing buzz around iPhone 7 with consumers possibly starting to show less interest in purchasing legacy iphone devices. In the past few weeks, Google Trends reported a growth in search interest around the keyword “iphone 7 release date”, which already has an average monthly search volume of 135,000.\r\n\r\n•         Despite seeing WoW declines, organic contribution of total gross adds remained steady at 13%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSales declined by 49% MoM\r\n\r\n•         MoM sales decline affected by seasonality (from Christmas sales) and conclusion of the AT&T Buy One Get One Free offer. AT&T received around 53,000 organic visits to the highly sales-targeted Samsung S6 BOGO page in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSales declined by 29% YoY\r\n\r\n•         Removal of free phones remains a strong factor of YoY sales decline. Free phones landing page contributed 2.6 million organic visits in 2015 (source: Adobe Analytics).\r\n\r\n\r\n[360i_logo.png]\r\n\r\nJohn Cho\r\nSEO Analyst\r\n360i | 32 Avenue of the Americas | 16th Floor | New York, NY 10013\r\nP: 212.703.7291 | F: 212.703.7255 | john.cho@360i.com<mailto:john.cho@360i.com>\r\nWeb: 360i.com<http://www.360i.com/> | Blog: blog.360i.com<http://blog.360i.com/> | Twitter: @360i<http://twitter.com/360i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of this email and any attachments are private and confidential.

For example, if your label is named \"To Do\" in the subject line of your email either enter #ToDo or #To_Do for the label to render properly on your card.) *         Members: In the subject, add @username. Members can also be added by putting @username in the body of the email on its own line.

remained flat at 1% WoW\r\n\r\n•         Growth in search interest around unlimited plans was flat WoW with Search Console reporting a 1% decline in clicks from “unlimited” terms.\r\nThe good news is that the majority of unlimited traffic has now shifted to the proper unlimited plan marketing page<https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/unlimited-plan.html>, instead of the data usage page<https://www.att.com/esupport/datausage/datausage.d.jsp> and features list page<https://www.att.com/shop/wireless/features/featureslist.html> which captured a greater share of the search interest in previous weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic grew by 38% MoM\r\n\r\n•         Seasonality and unlimited data plan & Next announcement continue to be the main factors of MoM traffic growth in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraffic grew by 5% YoY\r\n\r\n•         Unlimited data plan & Next announcement continue to be strong factors of YoY traffic growth in January.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSales declined by 4% WoW\r\n\r\n•         Search console reported a WoW decline in clicks from both branded & non-branded iphone keywords. The WoW declines may in part be due to the growing buzz around iPhone 7 with consumers possibly starting to show less interest in purchasing legacy iphone devices. In the past few weeks, Google Trends reported a growth in search interest around the keyword “iphone 7 release date”, which already has an average monthly search volume of 135,000.\r\n\r\n•         Despite seeing WoW declines, organic contribution of total gross adds remained steady at 13%.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSales declined by 49% MoM\r\n\r\n•         MoM sales decline affected by seasonality (from Christmas sales) and conclusion of the AT&T Buy One Get One Free offer. AT&T received around 53,000 organic visits to the highly sales-targeted Samsung S6 BOGO page in December.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSales declined by 29% YoY\r\n\r\n•         Removal of free phones remains a strong factor of YoY sales decline. Free phones landing page contributed 2.6 million organic visits in 2015 (source: Adobe Analytics).\r\n\r\n\r\n[360i_logo.png]\r\n\r\nJohn Cho\r\nSEO Analyst\r\n360i | 32 Avenue of the Americas | 16th Floor | New York, NY 10013\r\nP: 212.703.7291 | F: 212.703.7255 | john.cho@360i.com<mailto:john.cho@360i.com>\r\nWeb: 360i.com<http://www.360i.com/> | Blog: blog.360i.com<http://blog.360i.com/> | Twitter: @360i<http://twitter.com/360i>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of this email and any attachments are private and confidential.

There is a concern from the business in regards to content that would be found on the Wireless and Wearables landers.  Below is a snapshot from the Wireless comp:  H1, image, title, and description are the elements found.\r\nThe concern is if we omit the descriptions found within the tiles will this impact SEO or is there a way to add it to the meta data for SEO?  Leadership would like to remove it as it seems to have no value to the customer facing experience, and creates noise on the page, as well as usability has shown user's don't read the descriptions, only when the title is not informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D15D18.CBCEC8E0]\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a call is needed.\r\n\r\nBest and thank you kindly,\r\nMichelle\r\n\r\nMichelle Schultz\r\nSenior Producer | Wireless Sales\r\nAT&T Digital Design & UX\r\n* Cell: 206.375.2928 (L) 206.674.6783\r\nms165@att.com<mailto:ms165@att.com>\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D15D18.CBCEC8E0]Q Me!<qto://talk/ms165h>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of this email and any attachments are private and confidential.

There is a concern from the business in regards to content that would be found on the Wireless and Wearables landers.  Below is a snapshot from the Wireless comp:  H1, image, title, and description are the elements found.\r\nThe concern is if we omit the descriptions found within the tiles will this impact SEO or is there a way to add it to the meta data for SEO?  Leadership would like to remove it as it seems to have no value to the customer facing experience, and creates noise on the page, as well as usability has shown user's don't read the descriptions, only when the title is not informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D15D18.CBCEC8E0]\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a call is needed.\r\n\r\nBest and thank you kindly,\r\nMichelle\r\n\r\nMichelle Schultz\r\nSenior Producer | Wireless Sales\r\nAT&T Digital Design & UX\r\n* Cell: 206.375.2928 (L) 206.674.6783\r\nms165@att.com<mailto:ms165@att.com>\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D15D18.CBCEC8E0]Q Me!<qto://talk/ms165h>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of this email and any attachments are private and confidential.

There is a concern from the business in regards to content that would be found on the Wireless and Wearables landers.  Below is a snapshot from the Wireless comp:  H1, image, title, and description are the elements found.\r\nThe concern is if we omit the descriptions found within the tiles will this impact SEO or is there a way to add it to the meta data for SEO?  Leadership would like to remove it as it seems to have no value to the customer facing experience, and creates noise on the page, as well as usability has shown user’s don’t read the descriptions, only when the title is not informative.\r\n\r\n\r\n[cid:image002.jpg@01D15D01.6E0B2670]\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if a call is needed.\r\n\r\nBest and thank you kindly,\r\nMichelle\r\n\r\nMichelle Schultz\r\nSenior Producer | Wireless Sales\r\nAT&T Digital Design & UX\r\n• Cell: 206.375.2928 (L) 206.674.6783\r\nms165@att.com<mailto:ms165@att.com>\r\n[cid:image003.png@01D15D01.6E0B2670]Q Me!<qto://talk/ms165h>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe content of this email and any attachments are private and confidential.
